 # Xilinx FPGA symbol creator
This project aims to accelerate drawing of Xilinx FPGA schematic symbols using [pin description](https://www.xilinx.com/support/package-pinout-files/spartan-7-pkgs.html) text files provided by the manufacturer. The script generates a KiCAD Eeschema library that needs to be slightly modified to meet [KLC](https://kicad-pcb.org/libraries/klc/).
